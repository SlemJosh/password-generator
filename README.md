## Password Generator

## Description
This project was all about creating a script for a password generator.  I was given the HTML and CSS completed, as well as some basic parameters for how
the program is supposed to run.  What really helped me in this process was going through a list of things before I ever even started coding.  I put down
what I needed to do, step by step in order for the program to function.  Then it was as simple as plugging in each part of that.  Prompt by prompt I was 
constantly checking and trying to break my program.  The idea being that if I could figure out issues with one prompt, as I moved onto the next, those same 
issues would likely not be present.  

I did a good amount of research on the W3 schools as well as other sites to try and find different ways of doing what I was shown how to in class demonstrations.
There are some places where I can see that I will likely want to come back to this program and do some further editing and reshaping of the code.

-This page helped me figure out to get a random string based on the information that I had acquired from the user.

-When it came to some of the math, I used this to simply, as I didn't like having code repeating itself.
